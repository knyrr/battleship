# Battleship

This simple game is a one-player rendition of the classic Battleship.
The game secretly places ships on the 10x10 board in random positions and the player has to find them in 40 moves.

There are four ships of 1, three of 2, two of 3 and one of 4 squares.

Pink means missed, red hit and black sunk.
